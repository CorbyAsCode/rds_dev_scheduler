# rds_dev_scheduler
AWS RDS development instance automation

These scripts and configurations are an attempt at automating the scheduled spin-up and shutdown of Development RDS instances.
Use of these scripts will allow you to schedule RDS instance deletion whenever you're not expecting your developers to be using 
the databases, thereby, saving you lots of $$$.
